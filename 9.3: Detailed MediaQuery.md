### **Detailed Lecture on MediaQuery in Flutter**

---

**Objective:**  
By the end of this lecture, you will have a comprehensive understanding of **MediaQuery** in Flutter. You will learn how to utilize **MediaQuery** to make responsive layouts, handle screen dimensions, orientation changes, and safe areas in Flutter.

---

### **1. Introduction to MediaQuery**

In Flutter, **MediaQuery** is a class that provides information about the device's screen size, orientation, and other properties related to the device's environment. It is commonly used in responsive design to adapt layouts based on the screen's dimensions.

#### **Why Use MediaQuery?**

- **Responsive UI:** To adjust your UI based on the screen size and orientation (portrait/landscape).
- **Device-Specific Adjustments:** To customize layouts based on devices with different screen resolutions.
- **Safe Areas:** To avoid content being hidden under system UI elements like the status bar, navigation bar, or notch.

---

### **2. How to Access MediaQuery in Flutter**

To use **MediaQuery**, you need to access it using the `MediaQuery.of(context)` method, where `context` is the **BuildContext** passed to the widget.

```dart
double screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
double screenHeight = MediaQuery.of(context).size.height;
```

This code fetches the current screen's width and height, which can then be used to adjust the layout or size of widgets based on the available space.

---

### **3. Key Properties of MediaQuery**

#### **1. Size**  
The `size` property gives you the dimensions of the screen, which includes the width and height.

```dart
Size screenSize = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
double width = screenSize.width;
double height = screenSize.height;
```

- **Width:** The total width of the screen.
- **Height:** The total height of the screen.

#### **2. Orientation**  
The `orientation` property provides the orientation of the screen, whether it is **portrait** or **landscape**.

```dart
Orientation orientation = MediaQuery.of(context).orientation;
```

- **Orientation.portrait**: When the device is in portrait mode (height > width).
- **Orientation.landscape**: When the device is in landscape mode (width > height).

#### **3. Padding (Safe Area)**  
The `padding` property provides the area that is not covered by system UI elements such as the status bar, navigation bar, or notch.

```dart
EdgeInsets padding = MediaQuery.of(context).padding;
double topPadding = padding.top;
double bottomPadding = padding.bottom;
```

This ensures your content is not hidden under these system UI elements and provides a "safe area" for your app.

#### **4. Text Scale Factor**  
The `textScaleFactor` allows you to scale the text size based on the user’s accessibility settings, ensuring that your app respects the user’s preferences for larger text.

```dart
double textScaleFactor = MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor;
```

This value is typically set by the user in the **device settings** to make text larger for better readability.

#### **5. Device Pixel Ratio**  
The `devicePixelRatio` property tells you how many physical pixels correspond to a logical pixel. This helps in rendering the app at high resolutions for devices with Retina displays.

```dart
double pixelRatio = MediaQuery.of(context).devicePixelRatio;
```

It is useful when dealing with **images** and **icons** to ensure they are displayed at the correct resolution.

### **4. Practical Usage of MediaQuery**

#### **1. Creating Responsive Layouts Using MediaQuery**

**Example 1:** Adjusting the layout based on screen width:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  double screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;

  if (screenWidth > 600) {
    // For larger screens (e.g., tablet)
    return Row(
      children: [
        Container(width: 300, color: Colors.blue),
        Container(width: 300, color: Colors.red),
      ],
    );
  } else {
    // For smaller screens (e.g., phone)
    return Column(
      children: [
        Container(height: 200, color: Colors.blue),
        Container(height: 200, color: Colors.red),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- If the screen width is greater than **600** (tablet), it uses a **Row** layout.
- If the screen width is smaller (mobile), it uses a **Column** layout.

#### **2. Adjusting Widgets for Orientation**

Using **MediaQuery** to adjust UI components when the device orientation changes.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  Orientation orientation = MediaQuery.of(context).orientation;

  if (orientation == Orientation.portrait) {
    return Column(
      children: [ /* Portrait mode widgets */ ],
    );
  } else {
    return Row(
      children: [ /* Landscape mode widgets */ ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- If the device is in **portrait mode**, it arranges widgets in a **Column**.
- If the device is in **landscape mode**, it arranges widgets in a **Row**.

### **5. MediaQuery for Safe Area Considerations**

In Flutter, system UI elements like the status bar and navigation bar can obscure content. To handle this, you can use **SafeArea** to automatically add padding where needed.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: SafeArea(
      child: Center(
        child: Text("Content is within safe area!"),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The **SafeArea** widget automatically adjusts the padding to avoid system UI interference, ensuring that the content remains visible.

You can also manually use **MediaQuery** to control padding:

```dart
EdgeInsets padding = MediaQuery.of(context).padding;
return Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: padding.top),
  child: Center(
    child: Text("Content adjusted for safe area"),
  ),
);
```

---

### **6. Example: Responsive Text Scaling**

You can scale the text based on the device's accessibility settings using **MediaQuery**:

```dart
double textScaleFactor = MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor;

Text(
  "This is a text with scaling!",
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 20 * textScaleFactor,  // Scale the font size dynamically
  ),
)
```

**Explanation:**
- The font size is dynamically adjusted based on the **textScaleFactor**, which is set by the user in accessibility settings.

---

### **7. Combining MediaQuery with LayoutBuilder**

For more complex responsive designs, you can combine **MediaQuery** with the **LayoutBuilder** widget to further customize layouts based on the available space.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return LayoutBuilder(
    builder: (context, constraints) {
      if (constraints.maxWidth > 600) {
        return Row(
          children: [
            Container(width: constraints.maxWidth / 2, color: Colors.blue),
            Container(width: constraints.maxWidth / 2, color: Colors.red),
          ],
        );
      } else {
        return Column(
          children: [
            Container(height: 200, color: Colors.blue),
            Container(height: 200, color: Colors.red),
          ],
        );
      }
    },
  );
}
```

|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **size**                    | Returns the width and height of the screen.                                     |
| **orientation**             | Returns the orientation of the screen (portrait or landscape).                  |
| **padding**                 | Returns the padding (safe areas) around the screen (e.g., status bar, notch).   |
| **textScaleFactor**         | Scales text size based on user settings for accessibility.                      |
| **devicePixelRatio**        | Returns the pixel density of the device screen.                                 |
