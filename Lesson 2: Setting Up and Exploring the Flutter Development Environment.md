### **Lesson 2: Setting Up and Exploring the Flutter Development Environment**

---

#### **1. Setting up the Development Environment**

- **Prerequisites**:  
  Ensure the following are installed:  
  - A modern PC with at least 8GB RAM (16GB preferred).  
  - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.

- **Steps for Installation**:
  1. **Install Flutter SDK**:
     - Download the latest Flutter SDK: [Flutter SDK Downloads](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).  
     - Extract the ZIP file and add the `flutter/bin` directory to your system's PATH.  

  2. **Install Code Editor**:
     - Use **Visual Studio Code** or **Android Studio**:  
       - **Visual Studio Code**: Lightweight and versatile.  
       - **Android Studio**: Integrated debugging and emulation tools.

  3. **Install Dart and Flutter Plugins**:
     - For Visual Studio Code:
       - Open Extensions Marketplace, search for **Dart** and **Flutter**, and install them.
     - For Android Studio:
       - Navigate to **Preferences > Plugins**, search for **Flutter**, and install it (Dart is installed automatically).  

  4. **Configure an Emulator**:
     - Install Android Studio's **Android Virtual Device (AVD)** Manager or use a physical device with USB debugging enabled.

#### **2. Understanding the Development Environment**

- **Key Components**:
  - **Flutter SDK**: Core libraries, tools, and commands for building apps.  
  - **Code Editor**: Platform to write and debug code (e.g., Visual Studio Code).  
  - **Emulator or Device**: Platform for testing apps.  
  - **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Flutter's CLI enables project management with commands like `flutter create`, `flutter run`, and `flutter build`.

- **Environment Verification**:
  - Run `flutter doctor` in the terminal to verify installation and identify any issues.  
    Example Output:  
    ```plaintext
    [✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.x.x)
    [✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
    [✓] Visual Studio Code (version x.x.x)
    [✓] Connected device
    ```

#### **3. Create the First Flutter Project**

- **Steps to Create a New Project**:
  1. Open your terminal or IDE.  
  2. Run the following command:  
     ```bash
     flutter create my_first_app
     ```
  3. Navigate to the project folder:  
     ```bash
     cd my_first_app
     ```

- **Using Visual Studio Code**:
  - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`), type `Flutter: New Project`, and select the directory.

---

#### **4. Understanding the Flutter Project Overview**

- **Folder Structure**:
  - **`lib/`**:  
    - Contains the main codebase.  
    - Default file: `main.dart`, the entry point of your app.
  - **`android/` and `ios/`**:  
    - Platform-specific code for Android and iOS, respectively.  
  - **`pubspec.yaml`**:  
    - Configuration file for dependencies, assets, and project metadata.

- **Important Files**:
  - `main.dart`:  
    Contains the `main()` function and the root widget.  
  - `pubspec.yaml`:  
    Used for managing dependencies (e.g., `http`, `provider`).

---

#### **5. Build and Run the First Flutter App**

- **Steps to Run**:
  1. **Using Emulator or Device**:
     - Start an emulator using Android Studio or connect a physical device.
     - Enable Developer Mode and USB debugging on your device.
  
  2. **Run the App**:
     - In the terminal:
       ```bash
       flutter run
       ```
     - In Visual Studio Code:
       - Press `F5` or click the **Run** button.

- **Expected Output**:
  - The default counter app is displayed, showing a button that increments a counter.
