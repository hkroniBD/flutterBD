In Dart, **nullability** refers to whether a variable or a type can hold a `null` value. With the introduction of **null safety** in Dart 2.12, developers have the ability to explicitly define whether a variable can be `null` or not, helping to eliminate null reference errors at compile time.

### Key Concepts of Nullability in Dart

1. **Non-nullable types:**
   By default, variables in Dart cannot be `null`. This ensures that you can't accidentally access a null value, leading to runtime errors.
   ```dart
   int age = 25; // Non-nullable, must always have a value
   ```

   If you try to assign `null` to a non-nullable variable, the compiler will show an error:
   ```dart
   int age = null; // Error: Null can't be assigned to a non-nullable variable
   ```

2. **Nullable types:**
   To allow a variable to accept `null`, you append a `?` to the type declaration.
   ```dart
   int? age = null; // Nullable, can be either an int or null
   ```

3. **Nullable types in operations:**
   When working with nullable types, you must handle the possibility of `null`. Dart provides several mechanisms to work safely with nullable values:
   
   - **Null check (`!`):** The `!` operator tells Dart that a nullable value is guaranteed to be non-null at runtime.
     ```dart
     int? nullableAge = 25;
     int nonNullableAge = nullableAge!; // Assumes nullableAge is not null
     ```
     ⚠️ Use `!` with caution. If the value is actually `null`, it will throw a runtime exception.

   - **Null-aware operator (`??`):** The `??` operator provides a default value if the variable is `null`.
     ```dart
     int? nullableAge = null;
     int age = nullableAge ?? 18; // If nullableAge is null, assign 18
     ```

   - **Null-aware member access (`?.`):** Safely access a member or method of a nullable object without triggering a null exception.
     ```dart
     String? name = null;
     print(name?.toUpperCase()); // Prints: null
     ```

4. **Late initialization:**
   Use the `late` keyword for non-nullable variables that you intend to initialize later.
   ```dart
   late int age;
   age = 30; // Initialize later
   print(age); // Outputs: 30
   ```

5. **Optional parameters:**
   Function parameters are nullable by default unless explicitly marked otherwise.
   ```dart
   void greet(String? name) {
     print('Hello, ${name ?? 'Guest'}!');
   }
   greet(null); // Outputs: Hello, Guest!
   ```

### Benefits of Null Safety
- **Eliminates null reference errors:** By catching potential null-related issues at compile time.
- **Improves code clarity:** Explicitly marking types as nullable (`T?`) or non-nullable (`T`) makes the code more readable and predictable.

### Example: Nullable vs Non-nullable
```dart
void main() {
  int? nullableNumber = null; // Can be null
  int nonNullableNumber = 10; // Cannot be null

  // Null-aware operator
  int result = nullableNumber ?? 0; // Defaults to 0 if null
  print(result); // Output: 0

  // Null check
  nullableNumber = 5;
  print(nullableNumber! + nonNullableNumber); // Output: 15
}
```

Dart's null safety makes your code safer, more robust, and less prone to runtime errors caused by null values.
