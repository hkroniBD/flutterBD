### **Lesson Plan: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart**

This lesson introduces the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Dart, including classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. By the end of this lesson, students will be able to implement basic OOP principles in Dart.

### **1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?**

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (fields/properties) and methods (functions).  
**Key Features of OOP:**
1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods together.
2. **Inheritance**: Sharing functionality between classes.
3. **Polymorphism**: Using a single interface for different types.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details.


In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a **class** serves as a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) that define the characteristics and actions of objects created from it. The following are key concepts associated with classes in OOP:

---

### 1. **Encapsulation**
**Definition:**
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, the class. It restricts direct access to some of the class's components, usually by using access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `protected`, `public`).

**Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** To protect an object's internal state and only allow modification through well-defined methods.
- Attributes are typically declared private, and public getter and setter methods control access to them.
- This ensures data integrity and hides the implementation details.

---

### 2. **Inheritance**
**Definition:**
Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to derive properties and behaviors from another class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

**Explanation:**
- A child class inherits all non-private attributes and methods of the parent class.
- It can also override methods to provide specific implementations.
- Inheritance enables the creation of specialized versions of a general class.

---

### 3. **Polymorphism**
**Definition:**
Polymorphism (meaning "many forms") enables a single interface or method to represent different types or behaviors. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

**Explanation:**
- Achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism, where supported).
- Enables flexibility and extensibility in code.


### 4. **Abstraction**
**Definition:**
Abstraction focuses on exposing only the essential features of an object while hiding the implementation details. It helps manage complexity by modeling real-world entities with a simplified view.

**Explanation:**
- Achieved using **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.
- Abstract classes can contain abstract methods (without implementations) and concrete methods.
- Abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses.

### 5. **Class vs. Object**
- A **class** is a blueprint for objects, defining attributes and methods.
- An **object** is an instance of a class, with specific values assigned to the attributes.

### **6. Classes and Objects in Dart**

#### **Class Declaration**
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
```dart
class Car {
  String brand = '';
  int year = 0;

  void displayInfo() {
    print('Brand: $brand, Year: $year');
  }
}
```

#### **Creating an Object**
An object is an instance of a class.
```dart
void main() {
  Car car1 = Car();
  car1.brand = 'Toyota';
  car1.year = 2022;
  car1.displayInfo(); // Output: Brand: Toyota, Year: 2022
}
```

---

### **7. Constructors in Dart**

#### **Default Constructor**
Automatically provided by Dart if no constructor is defined.
```dart
class Car {
  String brand;
  int year;

  Car(this.brand, this.year); // Default constructor
}

void main() {
  Car car1 = Car('Honda', 2020);
  print('${car1.brand}, ${car1.year}'); // Output: Honda, 2020
}
```

#### **Named Constructor**
Used to define multiple constructors.
```dart
class Car {
  String brand;
  int year;

  Car(this.brand, this.year);
  Car.namedConstructor(String brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
    year = 2021;
  }
}

void main() {
  Car car1 = Car.namedConstructor('Ford');
  print('${car1.brand}, ${car1.year}'); // Output: Ford, 2021
}
```

---

### **8. Inheritance**

Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and methods from another class.

#### **Example: Inheritance**
```dart
class Vehicle {
  void start() {
    print('Vehicle started');
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  void drive() {
    print('Car is driving');
  }
}

void main() {
  Car myCar = Car();
  myCar.start(); // Inherited method
  myCar.drive(); // Specific to Car class
}
```

---

### **9. Polymorphism**

Polymorphism allows a method to perform different tasks based on the object.

#### **Example: Method Overriding**
```dart
class Vehicle {
  void start() {
    print('Vehicle is starting');
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  @override
  void start() {
    print('Car is starting');
  }
}

void main() {
  Vehicle vehicle = Car();
  vehicle.start(); // Output: Car is starting
}
```

---

### **10. Encapsulation**

Encapsulation involves restricting access to certain components of a class using access modifiers (`private`, `public`).

#### **Example: Encapsulation**
```dart
class BankAccount {
  String _accountNumber = ''; // Private variable
  double _balance = 0.0;

  void deposit(double amount) {
    _balance += amount;
  }

  double get balance => _balance; // Public getter
}

void main() {
  BankAccount account = BankAccount();
  account.deposit(100.0);
  print(account.balance); // Output: 100.0
}
```

---

### **11. Abstract Classes and Interfaces**

#### **Abstract Classes**
An abstract class cannot be instantiated and is used to define a blueprint.
```dart
abstract class Animal {
  void makeSound(); // Abstract method
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Bark');
  }
}

void main() {
  Dog dog = Dog();
  dog.makeSound(); // Output: Bark
}
```

#### **Interfaces**
Dart classes can act as interfaces when implemented.
```dart
class Printer {
  void printDocument() {
    print('Printing...');
  }
}

class Scanner {
  void scanDocument() {
    print('Scanning...');
  }
}

class MultifunctionDevice implements Printer, Scanner {
  @override
  void printDocument() {
    print('Multifunction: Printing...');
  }

  @override
  void scanDocument() {
    print('Multifunction: Scanning...');
  }
}

void main() {
  MultifunctionDevice device = MultifunctionDevice();
  device.printDocument();
  device.scanDocument();
}
```

---

### **12. Mixins**

Mixins allow code reuse in multiple classes.

#### **Example: Mixin**
```dart
mixin Logger {
  void log(String message) {
    print('Log: $message');
  }
}

class App with Logger {
  void runApp() {
    log('App is running');
  }
}

void main() {
  App app = App();
  app.runApp(); // Output: Log: App is running
}
```

|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Protect data and ensure controlled access.        | Private variables, getter, and setter methods. |
